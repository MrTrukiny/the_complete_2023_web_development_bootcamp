          I'm a full-stack developer specialized in JavaScript. Ever since I was
          a child, I have gravitated towards technology which helped me gather
          previous working experience in different companies. I consider myself
          curious and sensitive regarding the power of digital products, which
          motivates me to learn new technologies in a speedy but thorough way
          constantly. As part of my learning process, I like teaching other
          people once I feel I have mastered a topic.

            Overnights is a home-sharing platform providing listings and
            bookings of vacation homes. As a Technical Leader, I was in charge
            of the following:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style: square">
            <li>
              Listen to the client and stakeholder's requirements to turn
              them into technical solutions to communicate them to the team.
            </li>
            <li>
              Choose and set up the working tools to manage the project and our
              codebase, such as Jira, Bitbucket, Vercel, Digital Ocean,
              pipelines, and deployments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Elaborate on the System Architecture and technologies to use,
              define de code-style rules, and the branching and committing
              strategies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Manage the team and their tasks by being aware of their weaknesses
              and strengths and the necessities of our product.
            </li>
            <li>
              Give the last check to approve Pull Requests for both frontend and
              backend to guarantee the quality of the code.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep the work environment joyful, meaningful, and commutative to
              get the best of us every day.
